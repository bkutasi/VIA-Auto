# Automated VGG Image Annotator (VIA)

## Overview
This project is a backend implementation that automates the annotation function of VGG Image Annotator (VIA). It uses a trained neural network for inference, which significantly reduces the manual effort required in image annotation.

## Features
- **Automated Annotation**: The main feature of this project is to automate the process of image annotation. It uses a trained neural network model to predict annotations for a given image.
- **Integration with VIA**: This project is designed to work with VGG Image Annotator (VIA), a popular tool used for image annotation.
